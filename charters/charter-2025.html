          href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/me/">Media and Entertainment Interest Group</a>
          is to provide a forum for media-related technical discussions to
          track progress of media features on the Web within W3C groups and
          use of Web technologies by external organizations, and to identify use
          cases and requirements that existing and/or new specifications need to
          meet to achieve improved support for media services on the Web.

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The web has transformed media consumption worldwide through a set of
          foundational media technologies such as the
          <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlmediaelement"><code>HTMLMediaElement</code></a>
          interface,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source Extensions</a>,
          and support for real-time communications in browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Media and Entertainment Interest Group was created in 2011 under
          the name Web and TV Interest Group to track progress of media
          features on the web, discuss the future of media experiences, and
          coordinate related standardization activities in W3C groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Work in the Interest Group led to the creation of a number of groups
          at W3C over the years, set to incubate or standardize technical
          solutions, including the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working
          Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/tvcontrol/">TV
          Control Working Group</a>, as well as Community Groups such as the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/inbandtracks/">Media Resource
          in-band Tracks CG</a>, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webmediaapi/">Web Media API
          Community Group</a>, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">Multi-device Timing
          Community Group</a>, and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/av4browsers/">Audiovisual Media Formats for Browsers Community Group</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Interest Group also provided use cases and requirements to guide
          other groups at W3C and raised issues as needed to convey needs of
          the media industry across existing groups, for instance in the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Media Extensions Working
          Group</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text
          Working Group</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webapps/">Web
          Applications Working Group</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/media/">Media Working Group</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webrtc/">Web Real-time
          Communications Working Group</a>.

          technologies such as timed text, and input/output mechanisms used to
          engage users.
        </p>

        <p>Topics and areas that are in-scope for the Interest Group include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clients and devices (general-purpose browsers, televisions, tablets, phones, game consoles, cloud browsers, professional cameras)</li>
          <li>media providers (streaming web sites, terrestrial, cable, IPTV, satellite systems)</li>
          <li>media production (capture, identification, metadata, content enrichment)</li>
          <li>media transport and control (formats, packaging, storage, synchronization)</li>
          <li>accessibility of media experiences and standards</li>
        </ul>

          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from key media industries, and active Task Force leaders. The Chairs and Task Force leaders are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>. The group also welcomes non-Members to make technical contributions for ongoing work, provided they agree to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chairs should periodically look through the non-Members who have contributed to the Interest Group and consider whether each one should be invited to participate as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/">Invited Expert</a>. If a non-Member contributor would like to participate in meetings, they are encouraged to <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/me/instructions/">apply to be an Invited Expert</a>.

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Draft Notes and Editor's Drafts of deliverables will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">Media and Entertainment Interest Group home page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Media and Entertainment Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular areas tracked or investigated by the group, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
