      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a
          href="/2011/webtv/">Media and Entertainment Interest Group</a>
          is to provide a forum for media-related technical discussions to
          track progress of media features on the Web within W3C groups and
          use of Web technologies by external organizations, and to identify use
          cases and requirements that existing and/or new specifications need to
          meet to achieve improved support for media services on the Web.

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The Media and Entertainment Interest Group's scope covers Web technologies used
          in the end-to-end pipeline
          &mdash; including capture, production, distribution and consumption &mdash;
          of continuous experiences, which are here defined as videos, sound recordings, associated
          technologies such as timed text, and input/output mechanisms used to
          engage users.
        </p>

        <p>Topics and areas that are in-scope for the Interest Group include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clients and devices (general-purpose browsers, televisions, tablets, phones, game consoles, cloud browsers, professional cameras)</li>
          <li>media providers (streaming web sites, terrestrial, cable, IPTV, satellite systems)</li>
          <li>media production (capture, identification, metadata, content enrichment)</li>
          <li>media transport and control (formats, packaging, storage, synchronization)</li>
          <li>accessibility of media experiences and standards</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all deliverables, this Interest Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGNote">IG Note</a>.
        The Interest Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout the development of each deliverable.
        The Interest Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGNote">IG Note</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>The scope of the Media and Entertainment Interest Group includes
            tracking and review of media-related deliverables developed by other
            W3C groups, as well as coordination with other organizations in the
            media industry. As such, the Media and Entertainment Interest Group intends to
            coordinate around media topics with other groups and organizations as
            needed, per the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C
                Process Document</a>. As of the day of chartering, the following
            groups and organizations have been identified. Changes to these lists
            will be documented on the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">Interest Group's home
                page</a>.</p>

          Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

            Charter History
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Media and Entertainment Interest Group was created in 2011 under
            the name Web and TV Interest Group. Work in the
            Interest Group led to the creation of a number of groups at W3C over
            the years, set to incubate or standardize technical solutions,
            including the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second
            Screen Working Group</a>, the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/tvcontrol/">TV Control
            Working Group</a>, as well as Community Groups such
            as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/inbandtracks/">Media
            Resource in-band Tracks CG</a>, the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webmediaapi/">Web Media
            API Community Group</a> and the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">Multi-device Timing
            Community Group</a>. The Interest Group also provided use cases and
            requirements to guide other groups at W3C and raised issues as needed
            to convey needs of the media industry across existing groups, for
            instance in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML
            Media Extensions Working Group</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG">Web Platform Working
            Group</a>.
