        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The Media and Entertainment Interest Group's scope covers Web technologies used
          in the end-to-end pipeline
          &mdash; including capture, production, distribution and consumption &mdash; 
          of continuous experiences, which are here defined as videos, sound recordings, associated
          technologies such as timed text, and input/output mechanisms used to
          engage users.
        </p>

        <p>Topics and areas that are in-scope for the Interest Group include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clients and devices (general-purpose browsers, televisions, tablets, phones, game consoles, cloud browsers, professional cameras)</li>
          <li>media providers (streaming web sites, terrestrial, cable, IPTV, satellite systems)</li>
          <li>media production (capture, identification, metadata, content enrichment)</li>
          <li>media transport and control (formats, packaging, storage, synchronization)</li>
          <li>accessibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identification of requirements for tighter support of
            media-centric applications on the Web platform, possibly through
            the creation of Task Forces</li>
          <li>Incubation of technical solutions for the identified requirements by
            supporting the creation of Community Groups or Business Groups focusing on
            particular topics
          </li>
          <li>Suggesting existing Working Groups to include particular topics in
            their scope as appropriate</li>
          <li>Tracking and review of media-related deliverables developed by
            other W3C groups, and reporting of issues as appropriate</li>
          <li>Coordination with other organizations in the media industry to
            gather knowledge, coordinate input into W3C efforts, and promote
            development and use of W3C standards within global media specifications.</li>
          <li>Ensuring issues of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, performance, privacy, and security are given
          equal consideration in all discussions and outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Media and Entertainment Interest Group was created in 2011 under
          the name Web and TV Interest Group. Work in the
          Interest Group led to the creation of a number of groups at W3C over
          the years, set to incubate or standardize technical solutions,
          including the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second
          Screen Working Group</a>, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/tvcontrol/">TV Control
          Working Group</a>, as well as Community Groups such
          as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/inbandtracks/">Media
          Resource in-band Tracks CG</a>, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webmediaapi/">Web Media
          API Community Group</a> and the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">Multi-device Timing
          Community Group</a>. The Interest Group also provided use cases and
          requirements to guide other groups at W3C and raised issues as needed
          to convey needs of the media industry across existing groups, for
          instance in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML
          Media Extensions Working Group</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG">Web Platform Working
          Group</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within the Media and Entertainment Interest Group, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Main_Page/Media_Timed_Events_TF">Media
          Timed Events Task Force</a> investigates use cases and technical
          requirements for improved support for timed events related to audio or
          video media on the web, where synchronization to a playing audio or
          video media stream is needed, and makes recommendations for new or
          changed web APIs to realize these requirements. The Interest Group may
          create additional task forces to investigate specific topics and
          develop a common understanding of architectural implications and
          requirements the topic triggers.
        </p>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>The technical development of standards is not in scope for the
          Interest Group. Technical discussions are expected to take place
          within the appropriate W3C groups if such a group exists, or within a
          dedicated Community Group or Business Group when incubation is needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>We will have succeeded if we can achieve the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Participation via mailing list subscription and postings from people
              representing various stakeholder communities, including media professionals, broadcasters,
              hardware and software developers, telecom companies, cable operators,
              application developers, regulators, and users</li>
            <li>Members of the Interest Group join relevant Working Groups and drive the
              development of work items</li>
            <li>Members of the Interest Group start or join related Community/Business Groups and
              contribute to creating Interest Group Notes</li>
            <li>Constructive feedback on W3C deliverables posted for review on the
              <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-and-tv/"Media and
              Entertainment IG mailing list</a></li>
            <li>Engagement and coordination with other organizations in the media
              industry to promote adherence to W3C standards</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To achieve this, the Interest Group will organize regular
          conference calls to update members on progress of work items, and to
          invite other groups and organizations to present their work to
          Interest Group participants.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from key media industries, and active Task Force leaders. The Chairs and Task Force leaders are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">Interest Group home page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular areas tracked or investigated by the group, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-web-and-tv@w3.org">public-web-and-tv@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-and-tv/">archive</a>) and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/media-and-entertainment/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
